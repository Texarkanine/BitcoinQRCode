## Development

This project is open for pull requests. So feel free to contribute

1. Download the project using Git clone
2. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to initialize the jQuery-qrcode library
3. Start coding
4. Test your changes by dropping the index.html into your browser

### Image Variations

In order for the generated QRcodes to be downloadable when running locally, their decorative [images cannot be loaded with `img.src`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_enabled_image).

`js/embedded-images.js` defines a mapping of the image names to their data URLs. If this mapping exists at runtime, the generator will use the image data instead of loading the images.

`js/embedded-images.js` can be (re-)generated by running `node ./build/build.js`.
